## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I would not say that this particular exercise gave me the opportunity to learn something new; however, it did provide an opportunity to deepen my understanding of Bootstrap. I have worked with Bootstrap in my learning previously, but having not practiced for a while and not used it so much outside of tutorials, there were a few knowledge/understanding gaps.
Of particular note would be that I had forgotten about definining space and size using Bootstrap, and how to define this to be responsive based on the size of the window. While I feel this still requires further practice, I feel that spending time using Bootstrap outside of tutorials has contributed significantly to improving my understanding.

### Continued development

Naturally, I still hope to make greater use of and learn about further JS libraries. However, I feel that Saas would also be a good next step for the benefit of amending predefined styles in Bootstrap. In future projects, I also intend to use Bootstrap alternatives, such as Bulma.

### Useful resources

- [Mark Heath - Font Awesome Circle Background](https://markheath.net/post/font-awesome-circle-background) - This helped me since I often make errors when trying to make social media buttons in CSS. Using the guide here, I feel I achieved the desired result to create round buttons with a correctly placed icon in the middle of them.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - I had to refer back to this a few times to ensure I was using the classes correctly and in the correct place (in some case, for example, my columns and rows did not seem to be behaving correctly when I first added them in)
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/start) - A great selection of icons for all manner of things, but most importantly it provided me with the three icons I needed to complete this challenge.
